- **Device info**: Operating system, screen resolution, hardware details (CPU/GPU), used to improve compatibility and performance.  
- **Connection info**: IP address, general session metadata, and server addresses you connect to (necessary for networking functions).  

We do **not** collect payment information. Mojang/Microsoft login credentials are never seen or stored by TeaClient.

## 2. How We Use the Information

We use collected information for the following purposes:
- To ensure TeaClient operates correctly and securely.  
- To provide optional features like chat, friends, and community systems.  
- To store and deliver chat messages and friend requests within the TeaClient network.  
- To moderate and filter chat messages if necessary (to enforce community guidelines and protect users).

We do **not** sell personal data or share it for advertising purposes.

## 3. Third-Party Services

TeaClient relies on third-party services and infrastructure, including:

- **Mojang/Microsoft Services**: Used for Minecraft account authentication and multiplayer features.  
  - When you log in, your credentials are sent securely to Mojang/Microsoft servers.  
  - We do **not** access or store your Mojang/Microsoft password.  
  - Your use of Minecraft accounts is governed by Mojang/Microsoft’s Privacy Policy.  

- **Third-Party Hosting/Infrastructure**: TeaClient chat and accounts may be hosted on external service providers (e.g., database hosting, server infrastructure). These providers are bound by their own security and privacy policies.  

---

## 4. Chat Messages and Communications

- Messages sent through **TeaClient Messaging** are transmitted via our servers so they can be delivered to friends and contacts.  
- We may store chat messages **temporarily or persistently** to provide chat history, sync across devices, or for moderation.  
- Private conversations are only accessible to the participants and to TeaClient moderators if enforcement of rules or legal compliance requires it.  
- Harassment, spam, or illegal content may result in logging, reporting, or account actions.

## 5. Data Sharing

We do not share your information except:
- As required by law or government/legal requests.  
- To enforce our Terms of Service (e.g., addressing abuse in TeaClient Messages).  
- With trusted third-party providers that help us operate TeaClient (e.g., hosting, database providers).  
- With Mojang/Microsoft, indirectly, only as part of authenticating and using Minecraft.

## 6. Data Storage & Security

- Game settings and certain preferences are stored locally on your device.  
- Chat messages, TeaClient account details, and friends lists are stored securely on TeaClient servers.  
- Optional crash/error reports are stored securely and may include system and log data.  
- We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data, but no system is ever 100% secure.

## 7. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:
- Request access to information we hold about you.  
- Correct or update your information.  
- Request deletion of your TeaClient account, chat history, or related data.

TeaClient is **only for users who are 13 years of age or older** (or the minimum digital consent age required in your country, if higher) with parental consent.  
Please [read our Terms for more information](/terms).  

- **Enforcement:** If we determine that an account has been created by someone under the required age, we will suspend or terminate the account under our [right to terminate in the Terms](/terms). We will also delete any associated information, including chat messages and account data. To verify age where necessary, we may request government-issued identification or other proof of age. Any documentation provided will only be used for verification purposes and will not be stored longer than required to complete the verification process.  
- **Chat messages:** Because TeaClient provides its own chat platform, chat messages are considered personal information.
