<br/>

Hello TeaClient Users I am happy to announce that we have a wiki now avalible for both the user and the developer communities.

<br/>

The wiki features a lot of information essential to users of teaclient like getting-started, installing teaclient and more to developer communities using our api by searching our mod list and etc.

<br/>

This will be a great resource for both the user and the developer communities all around TeaClient.

<br/> 

Later this year we will be adding more information to the wiki like guides, tutorials, and more.
So stay tuned for more information on the wiki updates.

<br/>

Questions when is TeaClient Coming out?

Sometime 2025 don't know when.

What types of docs will the wiki serve?

All documentation, we have planned a registry when teaclient comes out to use a that cli to add your favorite mods and texturepacks that are not on modrinth and curseforge to TeaClient.

I have more Questions!
