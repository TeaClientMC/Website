This is the reason of the migration of discord's.

Today, I have fully demoted klaasa and kicked him from the project/product permenatly reducing a big monopoly situration of Klaasa controlling everything when I put in the hard work.
But today I need to make a statement of why I kicked him, what went wrong and what would be TeaClient future.


## Why did I kick him & What went wrong?

Well if you have been looking at when he was Co-CEO, he was promoting minecraft servers for the past 2 years so he could make money off of the server.

Promoting a discord server that is unrelated and not a partner.

Again promoting a discord server that is unrelated and not a partner.

And again promoting a discord server that is unrelated and not a partner for the last time.

There is more proof that is avaliable (eg. the last time he worked on TeaMC)
But I am unable to cover them all or this statement would be too long.

### Promises and Commitment

He was promised he would promote TeaClient, but as time went on he lost hope for this.

He was also not very commited to this project and staying with TeaMC which broke promises.


## What would be TeaClient's Future?

I plan to revive TeaClient Guild which is in my ownership and TeaMC in our main disocrd to something `Hypixel Skyblock` level and best part it's <p class="text-purple-200">Official</p> not unoffical.

Tyro is commited to TeaClient Passion (not like klaasa faking it) and is welcomaboard as Co-CEO of TeaClient.
I hope to bring back many of the contributors that were effected by klaasa's actions and use their creativity best to their ability.
