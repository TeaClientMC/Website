Today we announced that we officially have social media accounts for Twitch and Bluesky.  
1. Twitch redesign!  
Our Twitch redesign consists of an experimental TeaClient social media bot (if it goes well, it will be available on YouTube), our new banners, and our new social panels!  

2. Bluesky  
We recently created a Bluesky account to serve the exact content as x.com but on Bluesky! All will be automated once our infrastructure is up!  

I hope you enjoy the social media accounts and [checkout our bluesky](/bluesky) and [twitch](/twitch) today! 

# Questions  
- Preorders: Yes, there is a confirmed process for preorders; however, we want to decide on a fair price for 2 capes plus beta access. You can [vote for that in our Discord](/discord)  
- What versions? 1.8.9 and latest versions  
- When is it going to finally be out? We have a deadline locked in for November for beta testers, then a month after for preorders will have access, so I think maybe sometime in 2026. However, this is not confirmed yet! You can check for [updates in our Discord](/discord)  

I have more questions. If you have more questions, [make sure to mention them in our Discord.](/discord)  

I hope you enjoy this update. We are working our hardest, even sleepless nights myself to manage website, client, launcher, registry(Comming next news post!) and api, to get this out!
